# A bunch of example applications

Here's a set of VFS 6502 programs to get you started.

  * `asciinema.prg` A handled to play *asciinema format files* from the VFS with ease.
  * `debug.eXe` A basic debug program I was using throughout development.
  * `dosbox.prg` Reads `.dos` files to provide a DOSBos application in the browser.
  * `dumpcore.prg` Used for well, dumping out the core memory, and this really should be a `.eXe` instead of a `.prg`, or better yet, support it in `.prx`.
  * `Markdown.prg` is used as a handler for `.md` files, and was used heavily until I created `SHELL.SYS`.
  * `mkdos.prg` is used to make a `.dos` file needed for `dosbox.prg` to run.
  * `mkrc.prg`' This is used to create a `folder.rc` file, which should be used to protect system folders from prying eyes on a public deployment.
  * `mkvideo.prg` Is used to create `.vid` file for hosting an embedded YouTube video.
  * `mkweblink.prg` is used to create `.lnk` files to link to other websites.
  * `PlayVideo.prg` is used to open `.vid` files and display the embedded YouTube video.
  * `weblink.prg` is used to open `.lnk` files and perform the redirect.
